h1. yakriak

A simple web-based chatroom app.  Designed as a proof-of-concept for
Ben Black's Riak training at VelocityConf 2010.

h2. Features / Problems

* Everything is stored and served out of Riak. Take that, couchapps!
* Tested in Chrome, Safari, Firefox. Other browsers, caveat emptor.
* Remembers your login credentials via unencrypted cookies.
* Randomizes the polling interval to avoid dogpile effects.
* Uses full-bucket map-reduce, so won't perform well at huge numbers of messages.
* Use gravatar, should you decide not to remain anonymous.

h2. Setup

# Startup Riak locally on the standard HTTP port (8098).
# Join your local node to the cluster, if necessary.
# Run the @load.sh@ bash script.
# Visit "http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/yak/index.html":http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/yak/index.html
